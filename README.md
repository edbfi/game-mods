Mods for games I play. One folder per game, one subfolder per mod.

## Download

A **release** is a version of one mod picked to keep, with a version number. A **nightly** is the latest build of
`main`: every change, built and checked by the mod's tests, but not necessarily tried in-game. Each mod's README says how to install it.

Nightly downloads go through [nightly.link](https://nightly.link). If it fails, open the
[latest successful nightly run](https://github.com/edbfi/game-mods/actions/workflows/nightly.yml?query=branch%3Amain+is%3Asuccess)
and download the mod under **Artifacts** (this needs a GitHub sign-in).

Every download is submitted to VirusTotal: a release's report links are in its notes, a nightly's in the table
above and in its run's summary. A memory-patching trainer can still trip heuristic detections.

<!-- The nightly workflow rewrites the links between these markers after each scan. -->

## Develop

Each mod has a `justfile` with `test`, `build` and `package <version>`. From the repo root, `just test` and
`just build` run them for every mod.
